# Using Azure Pipelines with PDK 

1.  Follow the instructions for installing the caching task in your Azure Devops Organization
 - https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-artifact-caching-tasks#onboarding

2.  The provided azure-pipelines.yml will use caching if you provide a GUID to the artifact feed.  The easiest way to find the GUID for your artifact feed is to edit the pipeline in the GUI and start to add a save cache task which provides a dropdown of feeds to choose from.  After you choose the feed and add it the GUID will show up in the yaml text to the left.  You can copy it out and then cancel saving the changes to your pipeline.
